Mapping design into LUTs...
Running directed packing...
WARNING:Pack:1543 - The register v_ADC_block/v_ffd0/Qn has the property
   IOB=TRUE, but was not packed into the input side of an I/O component. The
   register symbol "v_ADC_block/v_ffd0/Qn" has no connections inside the I/O
   component.
WARNING:Pack:266 - The function generator v_CGA_block/font_y<4> failed to merge
   with F5 multiplexer v_CGA_block/Mmux_char_out_13_f5.  There is a conflict for
   the FXMUX.  The design will exhibit suboptimal timing.

  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.

    IOB Flip Flops:                       1
  Number of BUFGMUXs:                     2 out of      24    8%

Average Fanout of Non-Clock Nets:                4.01

Peak Memory Usage:  4443 MB
Total REAL time to MAP completion:  2 secs 
Total CPU time to MAP completion:   2 secs 

NOTES:

   Related logic is defined as being logic that shares connectivity - e.g. two
   LUTs are "related" if they share common inputs.  When assembling slices,
   Map gives priority to combine logic that is related.  Doing so results in
   the best timing performance.

   Unrelated logic shares no connectivity.  Map will only begin packing
   unrelated logic into a slice once 99% of the slices are occupied through
   related logic packing.

   Note that once logic distribution reaches the 99% level through related
   logic packing, this does not mean the device is completely utilized.
   Unrelated logic packing will then begin, continuing until all usable LUTs
   and FFs are occupied.  Depending on your timing budget, increased levels of
   unrelated logic packing may adversely affect the overall timing performance
   of your design.
